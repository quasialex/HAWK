You are trying to stop a device that isn't in monitor mode.
Doing so is a terrible idea, if you really want to do it then you
need to type 'iw wlan0 del' yourself since it is a terrible idea.
Most likely you want to remove an interface called wlan[0-9]mon
If you feel you have reached this warning in error,
please report it.
